    Parameters
    ----------
    network : pypsa.Network
        The network object to which buses will be added.
    db : PlexosDB
        A PlexosDB object containing the database connection.

    Notes
    -----
    - The function retrieves all nodes from the database and their properties.
    - Each node is added as a bus to the network with its nominal voltage (`v_nom`).
    - If a node does not have a specified voltage property, a default value of 110 kV is used.
    - The function prints the total number of buses added to the network.

    Examples
    --------

def add_generators(network: Network, db: PlexosDB):
    """
    Adds generators from a Plexos database to a PyPSA network.

    This function retrieves generator objects from the provided Plexos database,
    extracts their properties, and adds them to the PyPSA network. If a generator
    lacks properties or an associated bus, it is either skipped or assigned default
    values. If a generator has no properties at all, it is skipped and reported at
    the end.

    Parameters
    ----------
    network : Network
        The PyPSA network to which the generators will be added.
    db : PlexosDB
        The Plexos database containing generator data.

    Raises
    ------
    Exception
        If an error occurs while retrieving generator properties.

    Notes
    -----
    - Generators without a "Max Capacity" property will have their `p_nom` set to 0.0.
    - Generators without an associated bus will be assigned to a default bus named "default".
    - A warning is printed for each generator missing required data.
    - A summary of skipped generators is printed at the end.

def add_constraints(network: Network, db: PlexosDB) -> None:
    """
    Adds constraints from the PLEXOS database to the PyPSA network.

    The function infers the possible kinds of constraints, based on the constraint name, properties, and memberships:

    1. Emissions Budgets:
        - Identified by the presence of Production Coefficient and RHS Custom.
        - These constraints limit emissions and can be mapped to pypsa.global_constraints.

    2. Line Flow Limits:
        - Identified by the presence of Flow Forward Coefficient or Flow Back Coefficient.
        - These constraints limit the flow on specific transmission lines.

    3. Generation Limits:
        - Identified by the presence of Generation Coefficient or Installed Capacity Coefficient.
        - These constraints limit the generation capacity of specific generators.

    4. Storage Constraints:
        - Identified by properties like Units Built in Year Coefficient or RHS Year.
        - These constraints limit storage capacity or usage.

    5. Other Constraints:
        - Constraints that don't fit into the above categories can be logged for manual review.

    The constraints are mapped to the PyPSA network as follows:
    - Emissions Budgets: Added as global constraints (network.global_constraints).
    - Line Flow Limits: Applied to specific lines (network.lines).
    - Generation Limits: Applied to specific generators (network.generators).
    - Storage Constraints: Applied to specific storage units (network.storage_units).

    For each constraint, the function checks for all RHS-related properties (RHS Custom, RHS Year, RHS Day, etc.).
    If multiple RHS values exist (e.g., for different time periods),
    the function aggregates or processes them appropriately (currently taking the average).

    Parameters
    ----------
    network : pypsa.Network
        The PyPSA network to which constraints will be added.
    db : PlexosDB
        The PLEXOS database containing constraint data.

    Notes
    -----
    - The function retrieves all constraints from the database and their properties.
    - It infers the type of constraint based on the properties and memberships.
    - The function applies the constraints to the network based on their inferred type.
    - The function handles various types of constraints, including emissions budgets,
        line flow limits, generation limits, storage constraints, and capacity constraints.
    - The function logs the application of each constraint and any errors encountered.
    - The function uses the mean of RHS values when multiple are found.
    - The function handles exceptions and logs errors for constraints that fail to apply.
    - The function uses the logger to provide detailed information about the process.

    --------
    >>> network = pypsa.Network()
